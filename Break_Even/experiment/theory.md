### INTRODUCTION <br>
#### Break Even Analysis in economics, business, and cost accounting refers to the point in which total cost and total revenue are equal. A break even point analysis is used to determine the number of units or dollars of revenue needed to cover total costs (fixed and variable costs).
<br>

### FORMULA
#### Break even (in units) = Fixed costs / (Sales price per unit – Variable cost per unit)
#### Break even (in sales) = (Fixed costs * Sales price per unit) / (Sales price per unit – Variable cost per unit)
#### Where:
- #### Fixed costs are costs that do not change with varying output (e.g., salary, rent, building machinery).
- #### Sales price per unit is the selling price (unit selling price) per unit.
- #### Variable cost per unit is the variable costs incurred to create a unit.
<br>

### GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION
#### The graphical representation of unit sales and rupees sales needed to break even is referred to as the break even chart. The point of intersection of the total cost line and the total revenue line is called the break even point.
