## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment : Break-Even Analysis

### 1. Story Outline:

Break-even analysis tells you how many units of a product must be sold to cover the fixed and variable costs of production. The break-even point is the point when there is no profit and no loss. Break-even is a situation where an organisation is neither making money nor losing money, but all the costs have been covered. Break-even analysis is useful in studying the relation between the variable cost, fixed cost and revenue.


### 2. Story:

The Fixed costs and Variable costs decide the point of break-even. Learn the definitions of each and input the values of the same to get the total fixed cost and total variable cost. Then input the selling price and units sold of the business product to calculate the revenue and the variable cost per unit. The break-even point in sales and units will be calculated and displayed. An interactive graph with fixed cost, total cost and total revenue will be displayed and the point of intersection of the total cost and the total revenue lines will be the break-even point. Input a different set of values of total fixed cost, variable cost per unit and the selling price to see its effect on the graph.  With the help of  the displayed formula one can calculate the Break even point (BEP). 


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
The user lands on the first page which has a black background. The heading is in Bold Cyan font, “Break-Even Analysis.” Below that the objective of the experiment is displayed in white and a white button to proceed to the next step is provided.


#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
-	To state the meaning of fixed costs and variable costs.
-	To state all the major costs involved in a business.
-	To calculate the total revenue based on the selling price and quantity.
-	To calculate the net profit/ operating profit.
-	To calculate the break-even point in sales and units, and the equation of break-even analysis.

-	To plot a graph with fixed cost, total cost and total revenue and find the break-even point.

-	To analyse the effect of cost and quantity on the break-even point.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1. We require the values of  fixed costs, variable costs and revenue to calculate the break even point in sales and units.

2. Fixed costs are entered as the input value and total fixed cost is calculated.

3. After calculating the fixed cost, the variable costs are entered and total variable cost is calculated.

4. Then, the selling price and quantity are entered to calculate the revenue and variable cost per unit.

5. The break even point in units is calculated from the fixed cost, selling price per unit and variable cost per unit.

6. Once the break even point in units is calculated it is multiplied with selling price to get the break even point in sales.

7. A graph is plotted with the fixed cost, variable cost and total revenue.

8. We can change the fixed cost, variable cost per unit and selling price and observe its effect on the graph.

#### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:
<br>
Q 1. In any organization, profits depends mainly upon<br>
a. Production cost<br>
b. Production output<br>
c. Revenue<br>

**d. All of the above** <br><br>

Q 2. Given selling price is Rs 10 per unit, variable cost is Rs 6 per unit and fixed cost is Rs 5,000. What is the break-even point?<br>
a. 500 units<br>
b. 1000 units<br>
**c. 1250 units**<br>
d. None of the above<br><br>

Q 3. The breakeven point is obtained at intersection of<br>
**a. Total revenue and Total cost line**<br>
b. Total cost and variable cost line<br>
c. Variable cost and fixed cost line<br>
d. Fixed cost and total cost line<br><br>

Q 4. Given Break even sales is 40,000 Profit earned is Rs 2,000 and fixed cost is Rs 8,000. Determine actual sales.<br>
**a. Rs. 50000**<br>
b. Rs. 20000<br>
c. Rs. 32000<br>
d. None of the above<br><br>

Q 5. The Break-even Point of a company is that level of sales income which will equal the sum of its fixed cost.<br>
**a. True**<br>
b. False<br><br>

Q 6. While measuring break-even analysis, it is considered that during a specific period there will be no change in general price level, i.e., labor, cost of material and other overheads.<br>
**a.True**<br>
b. False <br>

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls: NA

#### 2.6 Conclusion:
Time required to perform the virtual experiment. 
The approximate time required to understand the procedure to perform the experiment would take about 5 min. To generate data will take another 5 min. Calculating and entering the values of various entities in the Result table will take approximately 5 min. Answering the assessment questions will take about 5 min. Thus, the total time required to perform the experiment will require around 20 mins

## 2.7 Equations/formulas:
- **BEP (in units) = FC/(SP-VC)**<br> Where, FC is the fixed cost, SP is the selling price per unit and VC is the variable cost per unit.
- **BEP (in sales) = FC*SP/(SP-VC)**<br>Where, FC is the fixed cost, SP is the selling price per unit and VC is the variable cost per unit.
